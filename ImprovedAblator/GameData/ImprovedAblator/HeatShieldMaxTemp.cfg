// Stock heat shields are near perfect insulators and nearly thermally
// indestructible, so their ablator is meaningless. ModuleAblatorImproved
// takes care of making them fail when ablator is depleted, but you can
// still slam into Eve at interplanetary speeds and expect to surive so
// long as you have ablator left.
//
// To fix that, make shields fail in extreme conditions, even when not
// depleted. They're still really tough, but they'll crack or otherwise
// stop protecting you if you really abuse them.
//
// This patch will only modify something that looks like a heat shield.
// Category thermal, maxtemp 3300, has ablator.
//
// This applies before the ModuleAblatorImproved module patch so it must
// match ModuleAblator.
